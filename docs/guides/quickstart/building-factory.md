# Building a Factory

A factory is a frontend app that allows creators to create NFT collections within the Open Format protocol. Developers and designers can create custom minting experiences that are multi-tenancy or for a single creator. A factory could handle deploying NFT collections, displaying NFT collection information and even enable creators to manage values and properties such as revenue sharing and sales commissions.

We've created a factory-starter to help onboard developers and create their first factory.
